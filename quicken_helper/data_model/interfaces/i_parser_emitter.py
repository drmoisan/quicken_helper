"""
Generic, runtime-checkable protocol for bidirectional text ↔ object converters.

This protocol models a *pair* of operations over a specific Quicken-compatible
file format (e.g., QIF, QFX/OFX, CSV): a **parser** that converts a textual
representation into an iterable of domain objects, and an **emitter** that
serializes such objects back to text.

The protocol is generic in the item type ``T`` to allow strong typing at call
sites (e.g., ``IParserEmitter[ITransaction]``).  The type parameter is marked
*covariant* so that a producer of a more specific item type can be used where a
less specific type is expected.

### Design goals & expectations for implementers

- **Determinism:** Given the same input string, ``parse`` must produce the same
  sequence of items. Given the same items, ``emit`` must produce functionally
  equivalent text (byte-for-byte equality is ideal but not required if the
  format allows benign variations like whitespace).
- **Losslessness:** Round-tripping should hold as far as the target format
  allows. Prefer the invariant:

    ``emit(parse(s)) == normalize(s)``

  where ``normalize`` is the emitter’s canonical formatting of semantically
  equivalent input.
- **Order preservation:** ``parse`` should yield items in the order they appear
  in the source, unless the format specifies a different canonical order.
- **Purity:** ``parse`` and ``emit`` should avoid global state and not mutate
  arguments. If internal caches are used for performance, they must not affect
  observable results.
- **Errors:** On unrecoverable format errors, raise ``ValueError`` (or a
  documented subclass) with actionable context (line/column/range if possible).


Note: This is a **structural** type (``typing.Protocol``). Any class with
matching attributes/methods is considered compatible without explicit
inheritance.

class IParserEmitter(Protocol[T]):
    """
    Runtime-checkable protocol for paired parser/emitter implementations.

    Implementations convert between a *single* Quicken-like file format and
    a stream of strongly-typed items.

    Typical specializations include:

    - ``IParserEmitter[ITransaction]`` for transaction files (QIF/QFX/CSV)

    Implementations may use a single signature `emit(items: Union[T, Iterable[T]]) -> str`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    file_format : QuickenFileType
        Identifier of the concrete file format handled by this implementation
        (e.g., ``QuickenFileType.QIF``). This is primarily used for feature
        gating, UI labeling, and dispatch at call sites. It should be a
        constant (per-class) value.

    Notes
    -----
    - Because this is a ``Protocol``, classes need not inherit from it; they
      only need to provide compatible attributes/methods.
    - The protocol is *runtime-checkable*, so ``isinstance(obj, IParserEmitter)``
      will return ``True`` for conforming objects.

    file_format: QuickenFileType

    def parse(self, unparsed_string: str) -> T:
        """
        Parse a complete textual document into an iterable of items.

        Parameters
        ----------
        unparsed_string : str
            The full contents of the source document. Implementations should
            accept any valid Unicode content for the target format. If the
            format is logically line-oriented, line endings ``\\n``, ``\\r\\n``,
            and ``\\r`` must be treated equivalently.

        Returns
        -------
        Iterable[T]
            A finite iterable (often a list or generator) of parsed items, in
            document order unless the format specifies an alternate canonical
            order. Each item MUST satisfy the type ``T`` used to parameterize
            this protocol.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the input cannot be parsed due to malformed content. Error
            messages should include enough context (e.g., line/column) to aid
            debugging.
        NotImplementedError
            If the implementation does not support a required feature of the
            declared ``file_format``.

        Notes
        -----
        - Implementers should avoid partial/implicit correction of malformed
          input unless such behavior is explicitly documented.
        - If the format contains multiple logical sections, the iterable may
          interleave item types, or you may choose to model ``T`` as a union.

        ...

    def emit(self, item: T) -> str:
        """
        Serialize an item of type ``T`` into a single textual document.

        Parameters
        ----------
        item : T
            Item to serialize. Implementations may validate invariants (for
            example, that split amounts total to the parent amount) and should
            raise with context if violations are encountered.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The emitted document as a Unicode string, formatted canonically
            (stable ordering, consistent whitespace/line endings) so that
            ``emit(parse(s)[0])`` is stable modulo normalization.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If item cannot be represented in the target format, or
            required fields are missing.
        NotImplementedError
            If the implementation does not support emitting specific features
            for the declared ``file_format``.

        Notes
        -----
        - Emitters should prefer ``\\n`` for line endings unless the ecosystem
          requires platform-native endings; this choice should be documented.
        - Implementers should not mutate ``items`` during emission.
